GDB integration for Node.js

This module provides an interface for controlling GDB from Node.js applications.
It began as part of the `atom-gdb-debugger` project, but has been split off into
its own package with no atom dependencies.

This is still very experimental and under construction.  If you try it, please
stop by the Gitter channel and let us know what you think.

There is no documented API yet as it has not been finalised.
